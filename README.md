# wordChallenge

Last update: 2015-12-30

My implementation of the Word Challenge game (yeah, I miss it).

I am just starting, so I only have a class for the wordtree that the game will use.

Will get serious later and do the rest.

Currently, running the main WordTree class will get a random 6-letter word from the Spanish dictionary
and will give all the words that have its letters.

To run:
 * 	mkdir -p bin
 *  javac src/gameintext/WordTree.java -d bin/ # Will complain about  unchecked or unsafe operations.
 *  java -classpath bin gameintext.WordTree
